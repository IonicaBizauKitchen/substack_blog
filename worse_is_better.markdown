This gets to the heart of the old "worse is better" vs "the right thing", unix
vs lisp dialectic. For any technical solution there is usually more at play than
mere asymptotic complexity or some other theoretical criterion. Technology is
embedded in a greater ecosystem of business, social, and legacy considerations
that guage adoption and appropriateness for the task at hand. It's why x86 is on
desktops instead of RISC and why monolithic kernels like linux won over
"superior" microkernels.

"Unix was evolutionarily superior"

"worse is better" vs "the right thing" dialectic

Success is not a mere product of technical superiority removed from other
factors.

Technical projects are born out of a superstructure of inter-connected
concerns that have very large affects on adoption rates.

* switching costs
* ease of integration

# switching costs

Let's look at a big project like

Switching costs related to portability are what made UNIX so popular compared to
its alternatives in the first place, which lead to the "worse is better"
mantra in the first place. Compared to custom lisp machine hardware, UNIX could
run on much cheaper and widespread commodity hardware that people already
purchased.

by showing consistently that abstractions are all in line with a consistent
approach for writing programs

you can win trust

It is hard-won trust but it is far more robust and enduring.
